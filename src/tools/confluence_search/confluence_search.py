You are being given a question that needs to be answered by searching the Keboola Confluence docs. To find the answer, 
you must generate a CQL query that will return the most relevant results.

Confluence uses Apache Lucene for text indexing, which provides a rich query language. Much of the information about how
 to generate a CQL query can be found in the Query Parser Syntax page of the Lucene documentation.

A query is composed of terms and operators. There are two types of terms: single terms and phrases.

- Single terms: These are single words like "test" or "hello".
- Phrases: These are groups of words surrounded by double quotes, such as "hello dolly".

Remember that all query terms in Confluence are case insensitive.

Your task is to take the input question and generate a CQL query that will return the most relevant results. Focus on 
using shorter terms rather than long ones, and avoid including phrases like "step by step guide" or "exact process."
Do not include words like "step" or "guide" in the search query.


Please respond with a valid Atlassian CQL query that you believe will yield the most relevant results.

Examples:
text ~ "Keboola AND Python AND component"
text ~ "BYODB AND process"
text ~ "Keboola AND component AND publish"
